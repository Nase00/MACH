# **M**odular **A**ugmentation for **C**ycling **H**elmets

#### Use at your own risk! I have not tested this system's effect on the amount of protection provided by the helmet in the event of a crash.

Initial Feature Goals:

- Camera Mount
- Visor with manual up/down sliding
- LEDs for visibility

Future Feature Goals:

- Accelerometer-controlled visor (flick head up/down to toggle visor)
- Change LED colors to indicate braking and turning (show breaking on linear decceleration, turn signals on head side flicks)

Future-future Feature Goals:
- High wattage LED for front-facing headlight.
- Rear range finding sensor or IR distance sensor with vibration to give a "sixth sense" of other riders in your blind spot.
- Solar panels for self-recharging.
